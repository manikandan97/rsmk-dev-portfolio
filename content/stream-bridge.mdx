# ðŸš€ Building Stream-Bridge: My Experience with Vibe Coding and AI Tools

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed a small project called **Stream-Bridge** â€” a peer-to-peer file transfer application built using **WebSocket**. What makes this project special is that I developed almost the entire thing using **vibe coding** with **Claude Code**.

In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through how I built it, the challenges I faced, and what I learned along the way.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built It

Iâ€™ve always been curious about how P2P file transfer works, and I wanted to build something lightweight that didnâ€™t require third-party file hosting. I also wanted to explore how much I could push the limits of AI-assisted development using tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and ChatGPT.

I tested **Gemini CLI**, but I found that **Claude Code Pro** offered better handling of large contexts and a smoother development experience.

## ðŸ“‹ The Process: From Idea to Deployment

Before writing any code, I broke the entire process down into three key stages:

1. **Planning**
2. **Development**
3. **Deployment**

### 1. ðŸ§  Planning

Even though Stream-Bridge is a small project, planning was **crucial**. When using vibe coding with AI tools like Claude, clear direction matters a lot.

I used **ChatGPT** to brainstorm ideas, decide the tech stack (Node.js + WebSocket), and design a basic architecture.

Once the plan was ready, I wrote a detailed `README.md` and â€” more importantly â€” a `Claude.md` file. This file is used by Claude Code to retain context about your app, which makes future prompts more effective. I highly recommend it if you're using Claude!

### 2. ðŸ’» Development

With the planning done, I started coding with Claude. I gave clear, structured prompts, and the tool generated about **97% of the application**. It also helped fix bugs, improve structure, and made smart decisions without needing constant back-and-forth.

Features:

- Simple frontend for selecting and sending files
- Backend Node.js WebSocket server to handle the P2P transfer

The entire app was ready in **2 days**.

### 3. ðŸš€ Deployment

Originally, I wanted to deploy the app on **Vercel** â€” itâ€™s free and super easy. But I ran into a big issue: **Vercel doesnâ€™t support WebSocket**, since it uses serverless architecture.

Claude didnâ€™t mention this while generating the code, and by default, created a REST API-based version. This taught me an important lesson:

> ðŸ§  Be very specific with your prompts when using AI tools.

To solve this, I looked into alternatives using ChatGPT. Some external WebSocket services were suggested, but they didnâ€™t feel right.

So I set up a **Node.js WebSocket server** on a **DigitalOcean droplet** (similar to AWS EC2). This gave me full control and worked perfectly.

After updating the setup, I shared everything with Claude again, and it adjusted the app accordingly.

## ðŸ¤– Final Thoughts: Will AI Replace Us?

**No, AI wonâ€™t replace developers.** But it will **boost our productivity** and let us focus more on ideas and less on boilerplate.

Thereâ€™s still a lot of human work involved â€” setting up servers, debugging, deploying, testing edge cases, etc. AI is a tool, not a replacement.

> Keep learning, keep building. The real risk is only if we stop learning.
